It was supposed to be a pure merger of the concepts which Swadesh proposed in [1952](@Swadesh-1952-200) and [1955](@Swadesh-1955-100). However, the editors did not notice (or deliberately ignored) that the former list explicitly lists the intransitive form of "to burn", while the latter lists "to burn" as transitive. So, after all, there should be 208 instead of 207 different concepts in the combined 200 and 100 item lists of Swadesh.},
